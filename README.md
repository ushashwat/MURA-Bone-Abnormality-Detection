# MURA-Bone-Abnormality-Detection
MURA: Large Dataset for Abnormality Detection in Musculoskeletal Radiographs


### Data Description
MURA is a dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs consisting of 14,863 studies from 12,173 patients, with a total of 40,561 multi-view radiographic images. Each belongs to one of seven standard upper extremity radiographic study types: elbow, finger, forearm, hand, humerus, shoulder, and wrist. Each study was manually labeled as normal or abnormal by board-certified radiologists from the Stanford Hospital at the time of clinical radiographic interpretation in the diagnostic radiology environment between 2001 and 2012.
